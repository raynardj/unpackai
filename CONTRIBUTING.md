# Contributing

Welcome! Happy to see you willing to make the project better! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³

This is how we generate the code:

1. Code is written inside Jupyter Notebooks to allow exploration (folder **nbs**)

2. Code and Documentation is then generated in folder **unpackai** by using `nbdev`
    * nbdev_build_lib
    * nbdev_clean_nbs
    * nbdev_build_docs --mk_readme False

3. Because `nbdev` does not managed well Test Cases that we want to extract in external files, we need to run a script to move the Test Cases in a dedicated folder:
`python test/extract_tests.py`

4. (not yet implemented) Run `black` (https://github.com/psf/black) on code in **unpackai** and folder **test** to format the code nicely


## Documentation

[README.md](README.md) is not managed by `nbdev` so it does not have be identical to **docs/index.html**


## Development

Cells shall start by following comment

* `# export` if the code of the cell (constants, classes, functions) are public
* `# exporti` if the code is private

Additionally, exploratory code that shall not be exported, should start with comment `# hide`.


## Test

Test cases are implemented using `pytest`.

You can find some good introduction to `pytest` here:
* Official Doc: https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/ 
* Website dedicated to testing in Python: https://pythontesting.net/framework/pytest/pytest-introduction/

Cells with tests in Notebooks shall have the following characteristics:
  * start by a comment `# exporti`
  * either contain `import pytest` or define a test function/class (`def test_xxx` or `class Testxxx`)

Tests shall be defined in functions starting by name `test_`
and can be grouped logically with classes starting by name `Test`.

For example:

```python
# exporti

def test_my_function():
     """Test my _function"""
     assert my_functin(1) == 1
   
 class TestTextual:
     def test_textual_from_url(self):
         """Test creation of Textual from an URL"""
         ...
         
```
